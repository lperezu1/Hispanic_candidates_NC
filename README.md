Hispanic candidates in North Carolina for nov. 2022 election 

## The News & Observer did this data project to obtain a statewide list of all Hispanic candidates on the ballot in the Nov. 2022 election. 

The N&O obtained this statewide list of candidates by joining the North Carolina State Board of Election's current 'Statewide Voter Registration' database with its '2022 Candidate List Spreadsheet (CSV) (with email addresses)' database.

The candidate list database does not include what ethnicity candidates identify with, while the voter registration database does. This merging of databases cross-checks which candidates identified as Hispanic or Latino in their voter rolls.

Some caveats: This list is meant to be comprehensive but may leave out Hispanic or Latino candidates if they did not register to vote or did not include their ethnicity in their voter rolls.
